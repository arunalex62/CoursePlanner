# CoursePlanner
Welcome to my CoursePlanner project. So far this is a work-in-progress, and is not user interactable unless you clone the repo and run the code.

# Usage
If you clone this repository, and open "src/Main.py" in an IDE, then add the line "API_Functions.Subject_CSV_Fill("{Course}")" to the main() function, where {Course} is a valid course subject at UVic, such as MATH or CSC, then running Main.py will generate a csv file of all of the courses of that subject and their pre/corequisites in the courses/ folder.
