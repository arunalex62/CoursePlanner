# CoursePlanner
Welcome to my CoursePlanner project. So far this is a work-in-progress, and is not user interactable unless you clone the repo and run the code.

# Usage
If you clone this repository, and go to the "src" directory in an IDE, run the code by typing: 
```bash
python3 Main.py
```
Then the program should run (assuming you have Python installed).
