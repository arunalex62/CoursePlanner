# CoursePlanner
Welcome to my CoursePlanner project. Version 1.0 is functional and works for Software Engineering students at UVic, and it is user interactable via command line if you clone the repo and run the code.

# Usage
If you clone this repository, and go to the "src" directory in an IDE, run the code by typing: 
```bash
$python3 Main.py
```
Then the program should run (assuming you have Python installed).
